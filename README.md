Mind Map Application
A feature-rich mind mapping application built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. This app allows users to create, edit, and manage interactive mind maps with real-time collaboration. It includes powerful features like user authentication, social features (adding friends), and cascading data functionality (e.g., deleting a map removes all of its children).

Features
Real-Time Functionality: Seamless, real-time updates for mind map changes, providing collaborative workspaces.
User Authentication: Firebase authentication for easy sign-up/sign-in with email/password or Google.
User Settings: Allows users to manage account settings, including deleting accounts and changing preferences.
Interactive Mind Map: Reactive, dynamic mind map where nodes are interlinked, allowing users to visually organize information.
Friendship System: Users can add friends to collaborate on mind maps.
Cascading Deletion: Deleting a map will also delete its child maps, ensuring data integrity.
